# e-VENT

e-VENT is a simple Java application and was developed to help events specialists for event management and/or event planning.

This is my team's final project in Programming Applications subject in Saint Louis University, Baguio City.

## Getting Started

To run this program, please import the SQL database to a wamp server.

1. Run WAMP Server. If you don't have such program then install.

2. Go to phpmyadmin in your localhost. If you don't know phpmyadmin, open your browser and type "localhost/phpmyadmin". Or right click the wamp icon in your taskbar and choose phpmyadmin.

3. Import the SQL file from the e-VENT DB folder. You will see an import button in phpmyadmin, don't worry. I don't need to explain this further. Moving on...

4. Now, run the program. Preferrably, use netbeans. If you also don't have this kind of program then install.
